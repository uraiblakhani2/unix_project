				<h1> <strong>Key Points of Global Change</strong>  </h1>
				<p> 
          <ul>
					<li>Most of the increase in global temperatures since 1950 has been caused by human activity.
           <br>
           <br>
					<li>The average temperature of the Earth is determined by the greenhouse effect
            <br>
            <br> 	
					<li>Global temperatures have increased by about 1° Celsius in the past century
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>The United States is the second largest contributor to carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>Arctic sea ice and glaciers are melting
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>Average sea level is expected to rise between 0.5 and 1.5 metres before the end of the century
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>Rainforest destruction is a major cause of carbon dioxide release
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>As global temperatures increase, our societies will find it harder to adapt to the changes this brings, and some species are more likely to go extinct
            <br>
            <br>
            </ul>
            </p>
         <section>
            <p></p>
            
          <strong></h1> The good news is that climate change is not an impossible problem. We know what causes it and what to do to stop it:</strong> 
           <br>
           
            <ol class="t">
           <li> It will take courage, ambition and details beyond lofty announcements for example:
            <br>

           <li> Reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is an ambitious goal, one that's going to require substantial effort across every sector of the economy. 
           <br>

          <li>We don't have a lot of time, but if we are prepared to act now, and act together, we can substantially reduce the rate of global warming, and prevent the worst impacts of climate change from coming to pass.
           <br>

           <li> What's most encouraging is that the low carbon economy that we need to create
           <br>

           <li>It will also give us cleaner air, better energy choices, new jobs and may even save us money.
           <br>

           <li> Likewise, many of the natural solutions that we need to adapt to even today’s climate change impacts benefit all of us.
            <br>

           <li>Leaner air and water, more natural recreation opportunities and jobs. 
            </ol>
