<h2>&#x02039;What is Global Warming and Climate Change?&#x0203A;</h2>
    Global warming and climate change refer to an increase in average global temperatures. Natural events and human activities are believed to be contributing to an increase in average global temperatures. This is caused primarily by increases in greenhouse gases such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2). A warming planet thus leads to a change in climate which can affect weather in various ways, as discussed further below. Six main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) (which is 20 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Water vapor is also considered a greenhouse gas.</p>
    
</p>
<h2>&#x022C6;The Greenhouse effect is natural. What do we have to do with it?&#x022C6;</h2>    
    Many of these greenhouse gases are actually life-enabling, for without them, heat would escape back into space and the Earth’s average temperature would be a lot colder. However, if the greenhouse effect becomes stronger, then more heat gets trapped than needed, and the Earth might become less habitable for humans, plants and animals. Carbon dioxide, though not the most potent of greenhouse gases, is the most significant one. Human activity has caused an imbalance in the natural cycle of the greenhouse effect and related processes. NASA’s Earth Observatory is worth quoting the effect human activity is having on the natural carbon cycle, for example...In addition to the natural fluxes of carbon through the Earth system, anthropogenic (human) activities, particularly fossil fuel burning and deforestation, are also releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

<h2>&#x02022;The climate has always varied in the past. How is this any different?&#x02022;</h2>
    Throughout Earth’s history the climate has varied, sometimes considerably. Past warming does not automatically mean that today’s warming is therefore also natural. Recent warming has been shown to be due to human industrialization processes.NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) tracks atmospheric global temperature climate trends. As environmental engineer, D Kelly O’Day, explained on ProcessingTrends.com (link no longer available): To facilitate assessments of long term trends, climatologists compare the mean for a base period with the annual mean. Differences between the annual mean and baseline mean are called anomalies. GISS uses the 1951 - 1980 period for their baseline period. They use the difference between the annual mean and the baseline mean to determine the global temperature anomaly for the year.</p>

<h2>&#x022C7;Who is most at risk of health effects due to climate change?&#x022C7;</h2>
    Children are vulnerable for several reasons. For example, children are more susceptible to heat stress and dehydration and are more sensitive to exposure to air pollution and smoke from bushfires. Their immune systems are not fully developed, putting them at increased risk of infections. They often need to rely on adults to keep them safe during emergencies and help them to recover afterwards. People living in rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people on low incomes and other vulnerable populations are also at increased risk, in part due to inequalities in underlying health outcomes and limited accessibility of healthcare and other services. People living in rural or remote communities or along the coast are also at risk from extreme events such as bushfires, droughts, storms and sea level rises.

<h2>&#x02605;Climate change will impact the lives of future generations&#x02605;</h2>

    There is no debate about this — climate change will most certainly impact the future generations. This global issue has the potential to take away everything we take for granted in this day and age. Our stable home will be flooded over. Our water will be dried out. Our crops won’t be able to grow because of the increased heat. Our oxygen will be limited as deforestation continues. Our air will be dirty due to pollution; and most importantly, our future family will have harder and shorter lives. If we don’t take immediate action against climate change, then this future may become both inevitable and irreversible. So think about it like this, although it may seem drastic, by contributing to climate change, you are actively destroying the lives of your future family.
