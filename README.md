# Project description/goals:
This is a repo which contains basic steps to setup a web server to host a website using a VPS. 
This repo also contains screenshots with instructions of basic tasks one might want to preform when setting
up their own server such as the creation of multiple user accounts and giving them permissions, 
basic security tasks like generating SSH keys, configuring the server with HTTPS and monitoring the server health.


<h2>In other words, this repo contains instruction to set up a VPS and a journal along with screenshots of setting up the VPS.</h2>



# Platform of choice: 
We choose to create a web server on a VPS and choose Google Cloud as VPS provider after comparing it with others.

# Requirements:
- Credit Card to signup for Google Cloud
- VPS
- Putty
- WinScp



# Major technical solutions compared: 
- Compared OS to be installed on the VPS
- Compared web server to use for hosting the site
- Compared VPS providers


# Timeline:
- 1st week: 
We compared the options for the softwares/vps to use and create list of pros and
cons for each and choose the best one and started working on the project by deploying the VPS.

- 2nd week: 
We secured our server and installed nginx for hosting our website and generated SSH keys

- 3rd week:
We uploaded the website through WinSCP and secured the website by adding SSL. 

- 4th week:
 We hosted the website on a domain and created a script which will automatically update the website files if any changes are made on this github
