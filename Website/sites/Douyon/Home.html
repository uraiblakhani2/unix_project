<h2>&#8377;Why should you join LongoFit?&#8381;</h2>
</p>
<h3>&#20803;Achieve your desired goal</h3>
<big> Only 30 minutes of exercise for five days a week can be your ticket to a better life. And if you can stretch that a bit more then attaining that 
    perfect figures you always dreamt of can be an easy walk. Visiting the gym on an everyday basis is one of the best ways to take care of yourself.
    All those sweating and exercising will not only help you build muscle or lose weight, but there are many other physical and mental health benefits
    of the gym that you had no idea about.</p></big>

</p>
<h3>&#165;Motivate you to overcome your stress</h3>    

<big> Usually people go to the gym to keep fit and have a body they can be proud of.
    People go to gym to escape their everyday problems and be in peace with their body. LongoFit can help release stress while you work out. 
    LongoFit has many things to help you overcome your situation like having a personnal trainer can help you achive your personal goal, motivate you to 
    overcome your stress.</p></big> 

</p>
<h3>&#10003;Losing those extra inches</h3>

<big>Joining a gym needs dedication and hard work, it will not instantly slim you down or make you grow a muscle but the gradual change you feel in your body will
    make you more energetic and build your stamina. Based on the rule of thumb, burning 500 calories on a per day basis will help you to lose 1 lb. per week 
    which is ideal for a person with moderate weight. In case you are on the bulkier side than losing 2 lbs. per week should be your basic goal.</p></big> 

</p>
<h3>&#38;Steering clear of nonsensical diet fads</h3>

    <big>If you are looking for quick weight loss, please be aware there is no such thing. Crash diets make you lose weight initially,
    but it also results in the nutrient deficiency that makes you sick and in the longer run when you fail to keep up with your crash diet 
    you will again start gaining weight. But on the other hand, in a gym such as LongoFit, will help and traing you tone you down gradually, 
    and regular exercise that comes with will keep you in shape and help you get one step closer of staying in shape.</big>
