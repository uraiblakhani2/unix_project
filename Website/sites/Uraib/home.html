        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p class="firstP">
          Cricket is a
          bat and ball game played between two teams of eleven
          players each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)
          pitch with a wicket
        </p>
        <p>
          &ast;The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team&comma;
          called the bowler, &apos;&apos;bowls&apos;&apos; (propels) the ball from one end of the
          pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being
          completed once they have legally done so six times.&ast;

        </p >
      </section>
      <section class="rules2">
        <h2>Batting</h2>
        <p id="secondP">
          The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with
          the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to
          strike the ball with a bat&#33;

        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn title="Batting">batting </dfn> side scores runs either when
          the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or when the two batters
          swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="rules3">
        <h2>Bowling</h2>
        <p id="thirdP">
          The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss
          each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their
          wicket"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled
          ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side
          either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a
          wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in
          front of the wicket to complete a run.
        </p>
        <p>
          When ten batters have been <b>dismissed</b> , the innings ends and the
          <sub>teams</sub> swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires,
          aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Fielding
        </h3>
        <p>Fielding in the sport of cricket is the action of fielders in collecting the ball after it is struck by the striking batter, to limit the number of runs that the striker scores and/or to get a batter out by either catching a hit ball before it bounces, or by running out either batter before they can complete the run they are currently attempting. There are a number of recognised fielding positions, and they can be categorised into the offside and leg side of the field. Fielding also involves preventing the ball from going to or over the edge of the field (which would result in runs being scored by the batting team in the form of a boundary).</p>
